# Getting started

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

# Requirements

- Implement todo app using following libraries: `Material-UI`/`styled-components`, `react-router`, `json-server`.
- Implement such functionality: `Two routes: one with all todos, one with done todos`, `Input and button to add todo`, `checkbox near todo to highlight it as done`
- How todos storing should work: `Using json-server, you must add every todo to the database`
- Todo fields: `[{title: "", id: "", done: ""}]`
